This document is mostly used to demonstrate malloc_consolidate and how it can be leveraged with a
double free to gain two pointers to the same large-sized chunk, which is usually difficult to do 
directly due to the previnuse check. Interestingly this also includes tcache-sized chunks of certain sizes.

malloc_consolidate(https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4714) essentially
merges all fastbin chunks with their neighbors, puts them in the unsorted bin and merges them with top
if possible.

As of glibc version 2.35 it is called only in the following five places:
1. _int_malloc: A large sized chunk is being allocated (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L3965)
2. _int_malloc: No bins were found for a chunk and top is too small (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4394)
3. _int_free: If the chunk size is >= FASTBIN_CONSOLIDATION_THRESHOLD (65536) (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4674)
4. mtrim: Always (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L5041)
5. __libc_mallopt: Always (https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L5463)

We will be targeting the first place, so we will need to allocate a chunk that does not belong in the 
small bin (since we are trying to get into the 'else' branch of this check: https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.35/source/malloc/malloc.c#L3901). 
This means our chunk will need to be of size >= 0x400 (it is thus large-sized). Notably, the 
biggest tcache sized chunk is 0x410, so if our chunk is in the [0x400, 0x410] range we can utilize 
a double free to gain control of a tcache sized chunk.

	for(int i = 0; i < 7; i++)

	// We would have to allocate this to be able to do tcache poison later, since we need at least 2 chunks in a bin to do it.
	// void* ppoison = malloc(CHUNK_SIZE);

	printf("So p1 is double freed, and p2 hasn't been freed although it now points to a free chunk.\n");

	// *(long long*)p2 = target ^ ((long long)p2 >> 12);
	// If we can edit chunk contents after it has been allocated,
	// that gives us UAF here and allows us to perform tcache poison.
	// We need to use a heap leak here due to safe linking.
	//
	// In reality since double free is usually the result of a dangling pointer,
	// we likely (depending on the nature of the vulnerability) could have used
	// the edit functionality on the dangling pointer directly. Oh well :)

	printf("We will request 0x400 bytes. This will give us the 0x410 chunk that's currently in\n");
